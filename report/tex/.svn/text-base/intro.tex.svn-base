\chapter{Introduction}
The purpose of this semester is learn how to design a programming language and a translator for this language.\\
This report will document the design of the programming language KAPAOOW(for sjov indtil vi finder på noget) as well as the implementation of the KAPAOOW translator.\\
Our goal is to create a simple structured and easy readable programming language that is easy to learn and to use for new programmers.\\
The language will be used for making of rule based strategy games, in which the rules and the AI's\footnote{Artificial Intelligence} will be customizable down to the smallest detail. This means that the programmer will be able to create all kinds of different rule based games.\\
It is also our goal to meet the formal requirements for this project as they are defined in the study regulation for SW4\cite{regulation}. The study regulation states that at the end of the fourth semester project, the student must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand and explain the the basic concepts of a programming languages syntax and semantic.
\item Document knowledge and overview of the applied techniques and terms in the language design and translator construction.
\item Explain the individually phases in a translator, and connection between them.
\item Explain the applied implementation techniques in the constructed translator/interpreter.
\item Use correct terminology.
\end{itemize}
