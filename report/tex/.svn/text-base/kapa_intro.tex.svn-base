In Section \ref{sec:criteria} we defined the criteria of KAPAOOW, with those in mind we designed our language for sequential turn-based games with a focus on readability and learnability. 


Every game is defined by its rules and because of this, a ruleset is mandatory in order to play a game. A game can have two participants playing each other. Each of these participants can either be a human player or controlled by an AI script. An AI script is created separate of the ruleset. Our language KAPAOOW is able to describe both rulesets and AI scripts.


In the code each participant is referenced as \textit{player} or \textit{enemy}. Where \textit{player} references to the participant that is currently playing, and \textit{enemy} references to the other participant. Because of this, these references changes each turn in a game. For some game examples and explanation of these look in Appendix \ref{app:codeexamples}.

The following chapter explains the structure of KAPAOOW and gives a thorough explanation of our syntax. We also explain parts of our semantics using structural operational semantics.
