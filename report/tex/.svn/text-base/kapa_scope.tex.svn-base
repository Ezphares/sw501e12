\subsection*{Scope Rules}\label{sec:scope}
The scope rules in a programming language determines which variables are valid and accessible in different contexts within a computer program. 

Each block in KAPAOOW has its own scope with its own variables that are accessible to itself and its sub-blocks, however to enable the game creators to easily access the variables needed when creating a game the following blocks have global variables:
\begin{description}
\item[Start block] Every variable that is assigned a value in the root scope of the \textit{start} block is global variables. These can be accessed from anywhere in both ruleset and AIs. The variables in the \textit{start} block in the AI on the other hand becomes global only in the AI. This block is only run when the game is started and can therefore be used to make variables that exists throughout an entire game.

\item[Attack types]Every attack type defined in \textit{attack types} are globally known and attack types can not be declared anywhere else.

\item[Character]The variables that are assigned values in a \textit{character} block is the character's attributes. They are globally accessible but might need to be referenced by a special keywords. If you want to know the value of one of your enemy's attributes you write: \texttt{enemy.attributeName}. Likewise if you want to know the value of one of your own attributes you write: \texttt{player.attributeName}. It is also possible to reference an attribute from within the \textit{character} block using just the name of the attribute. You can also execute your own character's actions from anywhere in both ruleset and AI by writing: \texttt{use actionName}. The names of the actions are therefore globally known.
\end{description}

It is also important to note that while the human and AI is only able to execute actions defined in the selected character, every code block in the ruleset are able to make changes to all game variables. This is because everything except the human and AI actions are a part of the rules. If humans or AI were allowed to change the game variables, it would be possible to cheat in whatever game they are playing.
