\chapter*{Preface}
This project was written as the 4th semester project by group SW407f12 - Software students from the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University in the Spring of 2012. The report documents the creation of the turn-based game language, KAPAOOW. This includes a syntactically and semantic analysis of KAPAOOW. This report also covers the process of developing an interpreter for the language.

We have included our knowledge from two of our semester courses, \textit{Languages and Compilers} and \textit{Syntax and Semantics}. The theory Chapters \ref{chap:lantheory} and \ref{chap:inttheory} are primarily based on the books related to our courses.
\\\\When reading the report, there are a few things the reader should be aware of:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{AI} is an abbreviation of \textit{artificial intelligence}, and is used throughout the project.
\item When a reference to a source of a section or paragraph is given, the number of the source is written inside square brackets $[\;]$. The number is a reference to the bibliography list on page \pageref{chap:bib}.
\item When the production rules of the EBNF exceeds the page margin, we use the arrow "$\hookrightarrow$" to symbolise that the previous line continues at the arrow.
\item The programmer who will be using KAPAOOW, to create games, will be referenced to as "game creators".
\end{itemize}
We would like to thank our supervisor Danny Bøgsted Poulsen for the feedback he has given throughout the project.
