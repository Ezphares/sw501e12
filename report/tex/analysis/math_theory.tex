\subsection{Trajectory Prediction}
From the time an object is detected, until the projectile can hit it, takes some time. To be able to hit the object, we must be able to know where it will be at the time of impact. We must therefore be able to predict the trajectory of the object.

If the object moves in an unpredictable pattern, it can be difficult to hit. A predictable parabolic or straight line pattern is almost essential to be able to hit the object. If the object moves in a predictable pattern, it is possible to know where it is at the time of impact.

Calculating the position of an object moving in a straight line is pretty simple. The only factors needed is the position of the object at a specific time, and the speed and direction of the object. If the object moves in a parabolic line, then calculating its position is a bit more difficult, because then you have to solve a quadratic equation.

If the object is flying, or it in other ways are moving up or down, there is a whole other level of complexity in the calculations. The objects movement will then go from a two dimensional plane to a three dimensional space.
