\section{Summary}
Given the different hardware, the Kinect seems to be the most straight forward to implement, as it is only one piece of hardware that can do the same as multiple other pieces of hardware put together. The Kinect also has software support in form of libraries like OpenCV that helps with the tracking of objects, something that could also be used with a webcam, but not with a LEGO only implementation.

The LEGO NXT has multiple different operating systems in addition to the one it ships with. Some of these operating systems have focus on real-time aspects, meaning that they have better support for scheduling, preemption and other real-time aspects.
