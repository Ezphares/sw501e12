\section{Summary}
The turret has been designed to be compact and the weight has been distributed to the bottom of the tower, making it quite stable and balanced.
The Microsoft Kinect has been chosen as the primary input source because it offers functionality that would otherwise need several individual components.
The nxtOSEK has been chosen as an alternative to the original LEGO OS. Python was chosen for the image analysis because of ease of programming. OpenCV has been preferred over Microsoft's own SDK as OpenCV offered some additional features e.g. Python development.
