\section{USB-protocol}
The USB-protocol needs to connect the results from the Kinect to the NXT. The specifications of the USB-protocol is not easily changable, as both the Kinect program and the NXT program is dependent on it, and a change would cause partial rewrites of both programs. It is therefore important for the USB-protocol specifications to be decided early, and not changed.

The USB-protocol needs to be able to connect the computer to the NXT, and in case of no NXT found, it should give an error.
When the NXT is connected, and the Kinect has found an object, the USB-protocol will facilitate the sending of the object-specific data.
More specifically, the data that needs to be sent is the x, y, and z position of the object, and the observed x, y, and z speed of the object.
