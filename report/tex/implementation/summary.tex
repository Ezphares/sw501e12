\section{Summary}
The implementation of the system is thus finished. The Kinect sensor has been implemented in Python with the help of OpenCV and Freenect. The NXT application has been implemented in C with the use of the nxtOSEK API. A USB connection is used to connect the two distinct parts. The entire system is compact in its implementation.
