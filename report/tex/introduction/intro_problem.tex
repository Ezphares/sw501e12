\section{Problem Statement} 
We want to construct a turret out of LEGO that is able to hit a moving target.

The challenges of this is: identification of the target, prediction of movement and aiming while target is within range. 

These problems will be solved using hardware sensors to detect the target, a computer for data processing and a sturdy LEGO construction for aiming precisely and quickly.

We will use a traditional waterfall approach to attempt the construction and evaluation on whether this is possible.
