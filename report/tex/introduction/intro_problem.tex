\section{Problem Statement} 
We want to construct a missile launcher out of LEGO that is able to hit a moving target.

There are some challenges with regard to the LEGO sensors and actuators. As the precision in the individual sensor and actuator varies quite substantially, making it difficult to do precise calculations and measurements. There are also some uncertainties regarding the speed and efficiency of the sensors and actuators. There is some doubt whether it it's actually possible to detect a moving target, send the signal, aim accordingly and fire before the target is out of range. It they prove to be to slow or imprecise, we need figure out if there are compatible alternatives or focus on hitting a stationary target.

We will use a traditional waterfall approach to attempt the construction and evaluation on whether this is possible.
