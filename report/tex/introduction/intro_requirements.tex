\section{Requirements}
The project proposal states: 

\emph{"Construct a tower with a missile launcher that monitors its surroundings and shoots incoming vehicles."} 

This is the basis for the project.

In order to successfully construct and implement such a tower with a corresponding launcher, the construction is broken into smaller and more manageable tasks that need to be solved.

The project requirements are divided into primary goals and secondary goals. The primary goals are the tasks that need to be solved for the system to succeed. Namely detection of the incoming target, prediction of targets trajectory, aligning the cannon and firing. \autoref{fig:req} shows the goals for the project.

The secondary goals for the project aim to refine and optimize the project. 
The following sections will provide a closer look at the individual goals in \autoref{fig:req}.

\subsection{Primary Goals} % (fold)
\label{sub:real_time_aspects}
\emph{"A real-time system is an information processing system which has to
respond to externally generated input stimuli within a finite and specified
period of time."\cite{realtime}}\\

Given the description in the project proposal this is clearly a real-time system, seeing as it should be able to identify, target and hit a vehicle before it is out of range. 

The most important feature of a real-time system is predictability. It is not uncommon for a system to downgrade performance in order to achieve a higher degree of predictability. 

The rest of the primary requirements are things that are needed in order to hit the incoming vehicle as the project proposal states. First detection of a suitable is necessary, thereafter prediction of the targets trajectory to establish where the turret needs to shoot in order to hit, then aiming of the turret correspondingly and firing the projectile.

\subsection{Secondary Goals} % (fold)
\label{sub:secondary_goals}
The secondary goals such as efficiency and compactness are design issues that could improve performance, making it possible to hit targets moving at higher speeds. Mobility and range could enable the tower to move in its environment or rotate 360 degrees and hit targets all around it. All of the secondary goals are hardware dependent and cannot be specified more at this point.
