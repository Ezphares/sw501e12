\section{Requirements}
Our project proposal states: 

\emph{"Construct a tower with a missile launcher that monitors it's surroundings and shoots incoming vehicles."} 

This is the basis for the project.

In order to successfully construct and implement such a tower with its corresponding launcher, we break the construction into smaller and more manageable tasks that need to be solved.

After we have gathered all of the tasks they are divided into hard and soft requirements, respectively. Hard requirements are requirements that need to be satisfied in order for the project to succeed. Soft requirements are less stringent and could in some cases be ignored and the project could still succeed. Table \ref{table:req} shows the list of hard and soft requirements for the project.

Our hard requirements are quite simple and self explanatory. As the goal for the project is to create a real-time system, this is of course part of our hard requirements, as there needs to be a high degree of predictability and consistency. The rest of the hard requirements are simply things that we need in order to hit the incoming vehicle as the project proposal states. First we need to see the target, thereafter we need to predict where we need to shoot in order to hit, then we aim tower correspondingly and fire. 

The soft requirements such as efficiency and compactness are design issues that could improve performance, making it possible to hit targets moving at higher speeds. Mobility and range could enable the tower to move in its environment or rotate 360 degrees and hit target all around it. All of the soft requirements are all hardware dependent and we can therefor not specify more at this point.
