The scope of the project is to make a LEGO NXT and a Kinect connect to each other and find a target. The NXT should control some LEGO actuators that can rotate a tower with a cannon, so that the cannon can be aimed at the target, and hit the target when the cannon shoots a projectile. The setup should be able to hit a round target moving in a straight line. The speed of the target will be set, but it should not be hardcoded into the system, instead the Kinect should measure the speed. Calculations of the targets position at the time of impact will be calculated using data from the Kincects measurements.
