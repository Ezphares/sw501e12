\section{Scope of the Project}
The scope of the project is to make a real-time system using a LEGO NXT and a hardware sensor that can measure the distance to an object. The NXT should control some LEGO actuators that can rotate a tower with a cannon, so that the cannon can be aimed at the target, and hit the target when the cannon shoots a projectile. The setup should be able to hit a round target moving in a straight line. The speed of the target will be set, but it should not be hardcoded into the system, instead the hardware should measure the speed of the object. Calculations of the targets position at the time of impact will be calculated using data from the hardware measurements.
