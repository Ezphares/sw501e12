\section{Scope of the Project}
The scope of the project is to make a real-time system using a LEGO NXT and a hardware sensor that can measure the distance to an object. The NXT should control some LEGO actuators that can rotate a turret with a cannon, aiming at a suitable target and hitting this when the cannon shoots a projectile. The setup should be able to hit a target moving in a straight line. The speed of the target should be constant, but it should not be hardcoded into the system, instead the hardware should measure the speed of the object. Calculations of the target's position at the time of impact will be done using data from the hardware measurements.
