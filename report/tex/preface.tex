\chapter*{Preface}
The following report is the result of the SW5E12 project for 5th-semester students of Software Engineering at Aalborg University. The report is based on project proposals by supervisors and written in the autumn of 2012, in parallel with development of the product described within. The report describes a real-time turret, built from Lego Mindstorms, capable of firing projectiles at moving targets, detected via a Kinect camera.

The reader is expected to have a basic understanding of programming languages and principles of real-time systems.

The group would like to thank Alexandre David for excellent supervision during the project period.
