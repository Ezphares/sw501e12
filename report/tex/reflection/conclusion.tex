\section{Conclusion}
The group has constructed a LEGO turret which hits a moving target with 76\% accuracy. The turret utilizes computer vision via a Kinect camera to identify a circular target and various trigonometry to place it in a coordinate system, aim at a predicted position and fire a projectile at the right time for it to hit the target. 
The system works in real time, and is within its deadline when the target is closer than 184 cm.

The group has thus fulfilled its problem statement, and the project is considered at success.
