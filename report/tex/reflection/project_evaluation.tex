\section{Project Evaluation}
All in all the group considers the project a succes. The turret can recognize and hit a moving target, and thus the requirements were met. Some things that the group would like to improve if they were to re-do the project were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item More focus on the real-time aspects of the project, i.e. better scheduling, more focus on making it adhere to the safety critical aspects e.g. implementing a check to see if the USB connection was still intact.
	\item The group excluded two members, and this was a good idea should have been done earlier. It would have saved a lot of time, that could have been spent on practical issues.
	\item More focus on explicit design. Given the time spent on group issues, the NXT program design with implementation and analysis. It would have been good to have clear phases in this.
	\item More time for testing/validation would have been good as it would have allowed a better use of validation tools such as UPPAAL.
	\item Maybe an explicit development method would have been nice to help with more structured development
\end{itemize}

The group however also has things that have worked well, for example the group work was efficient and communication was good after the exclusion. The project has also been a success in that it met all initial requirements and all current members have participated equally in the work.
