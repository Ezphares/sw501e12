\section*{Outline of the project}
The report is split into two parts. The first part is about our language KAPAOOW, and the second part is about how the interpreter for the language is implemented.

Chapter \ref{chap:lantheory} presents the theory that is used to describe a programming language. Chapter \ref{chap:kapaoow} uses the theory from the previous chapter to describe our language. Chapter \ref{chap:inttheory} presents the theory that is used to create an interpreter and the different phases an interpreter must undergo. Chapter \ref{chap:implementation} uses the theory from the previous chapter and presents how we have implemented our interpreter. Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} presents the conclusion, reflection and future work regarding the achievements and challenges in this project, as well as a reflection of the project and improvements for KAPAOOW.
