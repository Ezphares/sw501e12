\section{Reflection}
Looking back there are some things we could have done better or differently.

We chose not to research our intended target audience because this project was about creating a programming language, however research could have been helpful because it would have given us a better idea of how much experience the target audience would have, thus having a better idea of what criteria we should be focusing on.

Even though we managed to set up a basic environment for turn-based games, KAPAOOW is very limited to fighting games, which in hindsight was not what we intended it to be.

An implementation of a parser by hand is very time consuming, so using a compiler-compiler to generate a parser could have been a good idea. This would have generated a parser, based on our token definitions and EBNF. But we would have had to rewrite both of them to match the format of the compiler-compiler, which will have required a lot of work.

Our implementation of the scanner has an unintended side effect. Variables, characters, and attack types, that start with the first letters of a keyword, are considered as multiple tokens instead of one. For example a variable cannot be named "loopcounter", because the scanner would create two tokens: A LOOP token and an ID token.

Our interpreter is created using dedicated methods, i.e. methods in each node. In hindsight much of the interpreter could have been created using visitor patterns.
